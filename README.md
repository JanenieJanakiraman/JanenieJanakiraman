### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Janenie Janakiraman**, 

I'm a final year Computer Science student and my interests lie in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, AI in healthcare and Sustainability!


---Let's look into what I have been working on currently

#### ðŸ”­ Current Projects
- [
Efficient heat sink design generation and analysis through lightweight GANs.]: This project aims to use lightweight Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to efficiently generate diverse heat sink designs. GANs will automate the design process based on input criteria and constraints, accelerating exploration of the design space. Generated designs were analyzed using simulations to evaluate heat dissipation effectiveness. This approach promises faster iteration and innovative solutions in heat sink design.
- [
Multi-Modal Learning and Fusion Techniques for
Cardiac Disease Prediction.]: Worked on developing an advanced machine learning model to diagnose various types of heart disease, such as coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, using multimodal data. This project aims to use the clinical, echocardiographic, and ECG datasets to create a comprehensive diagnostic tool that integrates multiple views and modalities. By combining temporal data from ECGs, structural and functional insights from echocardiograms and MRIs, and vascular information from angiograms, we aim to enhance diagnostic accuracy and aid clinicians in making well-informed treatment decisions.

Smartphone-based diabetic Retinopathy detection system using CNN Knowledge distillation(Link to the project):

Within the Diabetic Retinopathy Detection project, an extensive analysis of Machine Learning (ML) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models was carried out. This rigorous evaluation aimed to assess the efficiency and accuracy of these models in detecting diabetic retinopathy markers from retinal images. The insights gleaned from this analysis significantly influenced the research's methodology, ensuring the adoption of the most effective and reliable models for early disease diagnosis
